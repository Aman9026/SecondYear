ecure Shell or SSH is used primarily for accessing a remote system, but it has many more features than that.

SSH is capable of:

Shell Access
File transfers
Executing remote command
Port forwarding and tunneling
Creating VPN
Forwarding X displays
Encrypted proxy browsing (via SOCKS)
Mounting remote directories
Execute commands

ssh user@hostname [command]

Authentication Mechanisms

Password
Public-key
Keyboard-interactive
Multiple passwords required (SecurID, etc.)
GSSAPI (Generic Security Services Application Program Interface)
Extensible to provide for Kerberos, NTLM, etc.
There is a great resource out there that gives examples of some of what the features listed above can do.
