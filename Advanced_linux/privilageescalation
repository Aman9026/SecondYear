t is best practice to never use the root account by default

In some distributions, trying to login as root remotely will add your system to hosts.deny

If multiple users login as root, it’s hard to tell what they’ve done to a system

If commands need elevated access in order to run use sudo

sudo takes a command as an argument and executes it as root

It looks at the sudoers configuration file and determines who is authorized to do what

If a user is allowed to execute a certain command, their normal password is required

There is a timeout that can be configured to allow additional commands to be executed without entering a password again

The timeout ensures that if a user steps away from the system, the user will not have elevated privileges for long

sudo keeps a log of:

1)Each command that was run while using sudo
2)Who ran the command
3)The directory in which the sudo command was run from
4)Timestamp of command executed

The sudoers file, located at /etc/sudoers is designed so that it can be used for multiple hosts:

1)Permission specifications
2)The user to whom the permissions apply
3)The hosts where the commands can be run
4)The commands the user can run

Sudo gives users a way to keep privileged commands inaccessible to users who don't need access. This is one small part of least privilge within Linux.
